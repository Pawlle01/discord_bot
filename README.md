# Discord Bot  

### Current State  
- Running (somehow) 24/7 on a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**.  
- `deploy.yml` auto-deploys to the Pi on every push to `main`.  

---

### Bot  
- Needs work.  
- At some point I’ll link the **Kraken CPU cooler repo** here, but for now it’s just a locally hosted HTML + Python API that returns whatever GIFs are in the `gifs/` folder.  
- Uploading new GIFs through the bot works.  
- Yes, this is an unnecessarily complicated setup. No, I don’t want to talk about it. Yes half of it is chatgpt.

---

### Soundboard  
- After moving to the Pi, it became unreliable.  
- Audio takes a while to play, probably due to the way files are handled and the Pi’s limited resources.  
- Needs fixing.  

---

### Contributing  
- If you have ideas, open a PR.  
- I’ll probably set up a dev environment for forks to auto-deploy somewhere for testing… but I might also procrastinate forever on that.  

---

### To Do (in no particular order)  
- Fix the soundboard delay.  
- Properly link the Kraken CPU cooler repo.  
- Set up a dev-testing environment. 
- Whatever else comes up.  

---

It works, mostly. The rest is negotiable.
